## Installation
If you want to use my configuration, you can clone my repository and use GNU stow to manage it.

Or you can place the configuration file in the correct location by yourself.

## Neovim
My Neovim configuration is based on [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim), with some of my own shortcuts, plugins, and settings.

Some plugins (not included in AstroNvim):
- (CopilotChat.nvim)[https://github.com/CopilotC-Nvim/CopilotChat.nvim] This plugin requires some operations for qualification verification.
- (project.nvim)[https://github.com/ahmedkhalf/project.nvim]

You can remap the `CAPS LOCK` key to `Ctrl` and `ESC` for better use of Neovim. You can refer to [this](https://kimi.moonshot.cn/chat/cqif2fatnn0lhuqbc9c0)


## Wezterm
My wezterm shortcuts follow the tmux style, with the leader key set to `Ctrl` + `Space`.
